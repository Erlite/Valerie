# Rick
Rick is a Discord Bot written in C#, using .Net Framework 4.6.2 and Discord.Net 1.0 library (Latest)

Rick likes to help out at times. Please don't bully Rick because Rick is old.

If you don't know how to setup Rick then please read the docs (ETA: 5 Squanches)
I'll soon write proper instructions on how to setup bot and provide a installer to make the process easier.

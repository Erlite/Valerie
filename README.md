<br>Porting to .Net Core soon:tm:</br></p>

Rick is written in C# using Discord.Net library 1.0 Beta latest version and .Net framework 4.6.1. Rick likes to help out at times. Please don't bully Rick because Rick is old. Rick has over 60+ Commands which include Admin, Owner, Fun, Google, Bing, Other APIs, Karma, Tags, Github, NSFW and many more! You can also use .Net Framework 4.7 and if interested I'm porting Rick to [.Net Core app](https://github.com/ExceptionDev/DNA) for Non Windows users.

Rick also logs every message that it receives and also gives user random Karma for their messages (This can be enabled/disabled in the guild settings).

If you clone this project or fork it or like it, please do leave a star. It does help a lot! Also, please do credit me in your program/Bot if you use my code.
